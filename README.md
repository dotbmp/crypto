## Example useage

```odin
package main

import "crypto/md4"
import "crypto/haval"

main :: proc() {
    md4_hash   := md4.hash(transmute([]byte)("foo")); // MD4 only has a single output size
    haval_hash := haval.hash_3_256(transmute([]byte)("bar")); // 3 rounds with output size of 256 bits
}
```

## API documentation


#
## Disclaimer

The algorithms were ported out of curiosity and due to interest in the field.
We have not had any of the code verified by a third party or tested/fuzzed by any automatic means.
Whereever we were able to find official test vectors, those were used to verify the implementation.
We do not recommend using them in a production environment, without any additional testing and/or verification

#
## Contributing

We welcome contributions in the form of implementations to not yet added algorithms, improvements to existing ones and of their respective test cases. Please adhere to the provided API design.
